	     <abbr title="Why share your salary information? Sharing your salary with others is helpful in starting a discussion that can benefit everyone involved by preparing you for salary negotiations, giving you a sense of the salaries made by others in similar roles with similar experiences. After you enter your information on this page, I'll walk you through a few ways to start a salary conversation with your friends or colleagues. | How are you using this information? This information is being used in two ways: First: To share back to you and others who use the tool to give you a sense of others' salaries. Second: For a graduate school project, as research. | Who are you? I'm Julia Haslanger, a graduate student in journalism at CUNY. My focus is creating things that would be useful for journalists, particulary journalists in new roles, like social media editors.">What is this?</abbr>
