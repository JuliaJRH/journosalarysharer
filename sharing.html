              <h3>Why share your salary information?</h3>
              <p>Sharing your salary with others is helpful in starting a discussion that can benefit everyone involved by preparing you for salary negotiations, giving you a sense of the salaries made by others in similar roles with similar experiences. After you enter your information on this page, I'll walk you through a few ways to start a salary conversation with your friends or colleagues.</p>
              <h3>How are you using this information?</h3>
              <p>This information is being used in two ways: First: To share back to you and others who use the tool to give you a sense of others' salaries. Second: For a graduate school project, as research.</p>
              <h3>Who are you?</h3>
              <p>I'm Julia Haslanger, a graduate student in journalism at CUNY. My focus is creating things that would be useful for journalists, particulary journalists in new roles, like social media editors.</p>

          Fair enough. Would you mind sharing a link to this survey for research purposes, if nothing else?

          Once you know how much other people in your position make, you'll be better positioned to negotiate for that raise or new job. So be the one to show your cards first. It's very "if you show me yours, I'll show you mine" topic. Talking about your salary shows conficense and business savvy. Go be saavy, believe in you!
        </div>
        <div id='text4'>
          Sure, go ahead and email or talk t happy hour with a few people about how valuable knowing what other people in your industry mak in similar jobs. I'd encourage you to at least tweet out that you're interested in chatting with people on the topic. And be the brave one who reveals your number first.
